Changes Made to the index.html file so the website it on a single html file

**JavaScript Functions:**
1. `showMain()`: This function is responsible for showing the "Home" section. It hides the other sections by setting their `style.display` property to 'none' and makes the "Home" section visible by setting `style.display` to 'block'.

2. `showLogin()`: This function is used to display the "Login" section. It hides the other sections, including "Home," "Sign Up," and "Play Video," by modifying their `style.display` properties.

3. `showSignup()`: Similar to `showLogin()`, this function displays the "Sign Up" section while hiding the others.

4. `showVideo()`: This function is responsible for displaying the "Play Video" section. It hides the other sections and reveals the video section.

**How to Replicate It:**

To replicate this functionality on your website, follow these steps:

1. Create the HTML structure:
   - Create a webpage with multiple sections (e.g., Home, Login, Sign Up, and Play Video).
   - Define the navigation links that correspond to these sections.

2. Add JavaScript code:
   - Add a `<script>` element within the HTML `<head>` or just before the closing `</body>` tag.
   - Inside the `<script>` element, define functions like `showMain()`, `showLogin()`, `showSignup()`, and `showVideo()`. These functions should use `document.getElementById()` to access the HTML elements representing each section and set their `style.display` properties accordingly.

3. Link the functions to the navigation:
   - In the HTML navigation links (e.g., in your `<a>` tags), use the `onclick` attribute to call the JavaScript functions when the links are clicked. For example:
     ```html
     <a class="nav-link" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="showMain()">Home</a>
     ```

4. Define your sections:
   - Ensure that you have corresponding `<div>` elements for each section with unique `id` attributes (e.g., "mainContent," "loginContent," "signupContent," and "videoContent"). These IDs are used in the JavaScript functions to manipulate the display.

5. Customize the content:
   - Modify the content within each section to suit your needs. In the provided code, you have content like forms for login and signup and instructions for the video.

6. Adjust the CSS:
   - Customize the CSS styles to match your website's design and layout.

By following these steps and adapting the provided JavaScript functions, you can create a simple navigation system to show and hide different sections of your website based on user interaction. This is a common technique for creating single-page applications and improving user experience by providing a smoother transition between different content sections.
